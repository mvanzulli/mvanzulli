### Short bio
Born in Uruguay (Montevideo, 1994) and graduated in Mechanical Engineering from Facultad de Ingeniería (FING) UdelaR. I received my master's diploma in Structural Engineering defending my thesis titled: Implementation of a consistent co-rotational nonlinear dynamic formulation and application to modeling overhead transmission lines. Nowadays I am a member of the research group named "Modelado e Identificación en Sólidos y EStructuras (MISEs)" created in 2018. The aim of this group is to develop computational tools based on solid mathematical principles for solving direct and inverse problems in structures and solids analysis.

I am an enthusiast about anything related to computational structural analysis specifically in open source code, also to spread awareness and work for making science more accessible, inclusive and equitable. If you are interested don't hesitate to contact me at mailtó: mvanzulli@fing.edu.uy

I'm one of the developers of [ONSAS](https://github.com/ONSAS/ONSAS.m), an open-source code for static/dynamic and linear/non-linear analysis of structures.

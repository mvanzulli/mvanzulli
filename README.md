I received my master's diploma structural Engineering defnidnning my thesis titualted: Implementation of a consistent co-rotational nonlinear dynamic formulation and application to modeling overhead transmission lines.

If you are interested dont hessitate to contact me at mvanzulli@fing.edu.uy

I'm one of the developers of ONSAS, an open-source cutting-edge software toolbox for reachability computations of dynamical systems, with potential applications that range from correct-by-design tools, safety-critical critical systems, and neural network controlled systems.
